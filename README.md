# notebook

A latex project that can be used as a notebook for a subject or a research diary or a logbook. It is a great way to keep a track of all your daily research work or study.
This is escpecially useful for anyone using linux as their primary operating system.

Advantage over other methods like preparing a word document is that we can quickly create pdf of any particular day, week, month or an year. Notes written on each day are stored as a seperate file. Thus preventing bulky word or latex file if it would have been written in a one single notebook over days or months. Even though a new file is created for each day, we can easily compile them files of each day or week or month or even a year with the help of simple single line command.
